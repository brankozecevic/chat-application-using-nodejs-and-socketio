# chat-application-using-nodejs-and-socketio
This is chat application built on node.js and socket.io. To run application position to main folder of application and type 'node server' in command line. To access application type localhost:3000 in browser.  Unfortunately application can't run on most of the shared hosting plans, because those plans don't provide command line access in most of the cases, but it will run nicely on local server (WAMP, XAMP...).
